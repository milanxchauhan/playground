<p>React - javascript library used to build user interfaces</p>
<p>it's a front-end framework</p>
<p>react works on the concept of 'components' - where each component is a combination of html,css and js files.
<p>// this allows us to neatly organize the website into sections.</p>
<p>// for example - while scrolling twitter you will notice that only the timeline keeps getting updated and not the entire page. the other parts of site remain as it is.</p>
<p>another thing react does is something similar to spot differencing</p>
<p>// whenever there is a new piece of data, it will compare the DOM tree and will re-render the component that has changed instead of re-rendering the entire page</p>
<p>every react app will have a div element with an id of 'root'</p>
<p>// everything we create using react will be inserted in this div element</p>

<p>simple syntax for rendering - ReactDOM.render(WHAT TO SHOW, WHERE TO SHOW IT);</p>

<p>2 different way to add dependencies -</p>
<p>var React = require("react");</p>
<p>var ReactDOM = require("react-dom");</p>
<p><-- OR using javascript ES6 --></p>
<p>import React from "react";</p>
<p>import ReactDOM from "react-dom";</p>
